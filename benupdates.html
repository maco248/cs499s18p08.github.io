	<h1> Ben's Updates 
		<h2>Update 1 - 2/11/17</h2>
		<p>Our group began by meeting with our client, Mike Flamm, to discuss the goals of the mobile application.  Our group decided to use React-Native as our platform through which we would build the application.  After our meeting with Mike, we had a group meeting where we all installed the software for React-Native so we could get started with learning how the platform works.</p>
		<p>Next we decided to come up with a design for the project, and develop the website for the project.  Collin and I would work on the design, while Nick and Malik worked on the website.  The design I came up with was a flowchart that went through each different screen of the app and how they functioned.  The idea was to make it simple to follow.  I used draw.io (a freeware web editor from Google) to create a flowchart of the design.  Collin came up with some ideas to implement and modify my design.  We then met with Mike on Wednesday, February 7th to discuss the design.  Mike liked the design, but gave us some criticism on additional features he wanted that we had not put in the app.  With these ideas in mind, I began to modify the design to fulfill these criticisms.</p>
		<p>Finally, I looked into some of the React-Native software to familiarize myself with it.  I wanted to be prepared once we began to code the application.</p>
