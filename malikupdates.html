	<h1> Malik's Updates </h1>
	<h3> Week 3 and before </h3>
	
	<p> To get our Mobile App project started, our team first formed a communication line with both the Database and Desktop teams through an online 
		platform called "Slack". Once this was done, we met with our client in person to get the details and requirements for how
		they wanted to project work.</p>
		<p>During our meeting we took notes and asked all the questions that we felt needed to be addressed.
		Hours after the meeting, we exchanged contact info for our emails, Slack accounts, and github accounts. This way could keep our
		client updated on the status of the project and give them live updates for them to try out.</p>
		
		<p>Once this was done we began setting up our coding environment and Android emulators to help simulate how the app will work.
		This past week, we had an online call with the cleint through Skype. This was done to make sure we fully understood the minimum 
		requirements as well as discuss some project features that we could possibly set as "stretch goals". </p>
		<p>Prior to the meeting, Ben and 
		Collin came up with a few User Interface designs for the app that we looked over and discussed as team. These were presented and approved
		by our client. A few days later, Nick and I setup the general layout and design of our project website. With everything setup, the team
		and I will begin working on the implementation of our app layout. </p>
